# Changes from New Agent Builder SDK Export

## Summary

The new SDK code from Agent Builder (`apps/new.md`) differs from the original (`apps/sdk.md`) in one key way:

**The `assignRemedialQuiz` function has been removed.**

---

## What Changed

### Original SDK (apps/sdk.md)
- **9 functions total**
- Included `assignRemedialQuiz` as the 9th function

### New SDK (apps/new.md)
- **8 functions total**
- `assignRemedialQuiz` is **missing**

---

## What We Did

### 1. Updated `blunote-agent.ts`

**Commented out the `assignRemedialQuiz` function:**
```typescript
// NOTE: assignRemedialQuiz was removed from Agent Builder export
// Keeping implementation here in case you want to re-add it to Agent Builder later
// To re-enable: uncomment this function and add it back to the tools array below

// const assignRemedialQuiz = tool({ ... });
```

**Removed from tools array:**
```typescript
tools: [
  trackConfusion,
  submitQuestion,
  generateQuiz,
  explainTopic,
  fetchNotes,
  getConfusionHeatmap,
  exportConfusionData,
  notifyStudentsViaLms
  // assignRemedialQuiz // Removed from Agent Builder - uncomment to re-enable
],
```

### 2. Updated Documentation

Updated `AGENT-SDK-INTEGRATION.md` to reflect:
- 8 active functions (not 9)
- `assignRemedialQuiz` is commented out but preserved
- Added note about the change

---

## Current Function List (8 Total)

1. ✅ **trackConfusion** - Record confusion events
2. ✅ **submitQuestion** - Save student questions
3. ✅ **generateQuiz** - Create personalized quizzes
4. ✅ **explainTopic** - Generate re-explanations
5. ✅ **fetchNotes** - Retrieve course notes
6. ✅ **getConfusionHeatmap** - Get instructor dashboard data
7. ✅ **exportConfusionData** - Export data as CSV/JSON
8. ✅ **notifyStudentsViaLms** - Send LMS notifications

## Removed Function

9. ❌ **assignRemedialQuiz** - ~~Assign quizzes to students~~ (removed from Agent Builder)

---

## Why Was It Removed?

Possible reasons:
1. You manually removed it from Agent Builder
2. Agent Builder didn't save it properly
3. Function exceeded some limit in Agent Builder
4. It was in a draft state and didn't export

---

## How to Re-add It

If you want `assignRemedialQuiz` back:

### Option 1: Add it in Agent Builder

1. Go to Agent Builder
2. Click "+" under Tools
3. Select "Function"
4. Paste this definition:

```json
{
  "name": "assignRemedialQuiz",
  "description": "Create and assign remedial quizzes to students who are confused. Automatically grades quizzes and tracks completion.",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "course_id": { "type": "string", "description": "The course identifier" },
      "quiz_type": { "type": "string", "enum": ["remedial", "practice", "assessment"], "description": "Type of quiz to assign" },
      "target_students": { "type": "string", "enum": ["confused_students", "all_students", "specific_users"], "description": "Who to assign the quiz to" },
      "user_ids": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" }, "description": "Specific user IDs (if target_students is 'specific_users')" },
      "topics": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" }, "description": "Topics to cover in the quiz" },
      "due_date": { "type": "string", "description": "ISO8601 due date for the quiz (optional)" },
      "passing_score": { "type": "integer", "description": "Minimum score to pass (default: 70)" }
    },
    "required": ["course_id", "quiz_type", "target_students", "topics"]
  }
}
```

5. Save and re-export the SDK

### Option 2: Uncomment in Code

If you don't need it in Agent Builder but want it locally:

1. Open `apps/backend/src/agent/blunote-agent.ts`
2. Uncomment the `assignRemedialQuiz` function (lines 427-463)
3. Uncomment it in the tools array (line 508)
4. Done!

## Impact

### What Still Works ✅
- All 8 remaining functions work perfectly
- Agent instructions unchanged
- Workflow ID unchanged
- All Supabase integrations intact

### What's Missing ❌
- Cannot automatically assign quizzes from agent
- Instructor dashboard "Assign quizzes" button won't trigger agent function
- Would need manual quiz assignment via LMS instead

---

## Recommendation

**For now: Keep it commented out** since Agent Builder didn't include it.

**Later: Re-add to Agent Builder** if you need automatic quiz assignment functionality.

The implementation is preserved in the code, so you can easily re-enable it whenever needed!

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `apps/backend/src/agent/blunote-agent.ts` - Commented out function
2. ✅ `AGENT-SDK-INTEGRATION.md` - Updated documentation
3. ✅ `CHANGES-FROM-NEW-SDK.md` - This file

---

## Testing Impact

When testing, remember:
- ✅ Test 8 functions (not 9)
- ❌ Don't test `assignRemedialQuiz` (it's disabled)
- ✅ All other functionality unchanged
